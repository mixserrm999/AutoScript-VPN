Advanced: Auto install using custom options.
</summary>

Advanced users can auto install OpenVPN using custom options, by providing a Bash "here document" as input to the setup script. This method can also be used to provide input to manage users after install.

First, install OpenVPN interactively using custom options, and write down all your inputs to the script.

```bash
sudo bash openvpn.sh
```

If you need to remove OpenVPN, run the script again and select the appropriate option.

Next, create the custom install command using your inputs. Example:

```bash
sudo bash openvpn.sh <<ANSWERS
1
1194
2
client
y
ANSWERS
```

**Note:** The install options may change in future versions of the script.
